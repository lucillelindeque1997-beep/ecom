## ðŸ’¡ Compromise Solutions

### Solution #1: Guest Checkout with Strategic Data Capture

**Compromise Agreement:**
- **Implement Guest Checkout** to reduce friction
- **Add pre-checked email opt-in** on shipping address page
- **Create post-purchase conversion funnel** for guest users

**Stakeholder Benefits:**
- **Marketing:** Maintains data collection through opt-in strategy
- **UX:** Achieves primary goal of friction reduction
- **Security:** Maintains basic verification without guest registration

**Implementation Details:**
```
Guest Checkout Flow:
1. Cart Review â†’ 2. Shipping Info (with email opt-in) â†’ 3. Payment â†’ 4. Confirmation
                                    â†“
Post-Purchase Follow-up:
Email 1: Order confirmation + account creation incentive (Day 0)
Email 2: Shipping update + loyalty program benefits (Day 2)  
Email 3: Delivery confirmation + account creation CTA (Day 5)
Target: 15% guest-to-account conversion within 30 days
```

### Solution #2: Balanced Security Framework

**Compromise Agreement:**
- **Maintain fraud verification** but optimize for speed
- **Implement background checks** during user input (not after)
- **Set performance requirement:** <0.5 seconds processing time

**Technical Implementation:**
```
Security Process:
â€¢ Real-time address validation (as user types)
â€¢ Background fraud scoring (parallel to user input)
â€¢ Card validation without additional user steps  
â€¢ Risk-based authentication (high-risk = additional verification)
```
