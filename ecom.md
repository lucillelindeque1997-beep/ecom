Case Study 1: E-commerce Checkout Abandonment ReductionRole: Business Analyst (BA) / Revenue Optimization Specialist1. The Conflict: The "Not Too Good" RealityThe client, a mid-sized e-commerce retailer, faces a critical problem: a 30% cart abandonment rate at the final payment stage, equating to an estimated $500,000 in monthly lost revenue. While initial data pointed to simple fixes (mobile UI and mandatory account creation), real BA work demanded navigating significant stakeholder resistance:Marketing Director Conflict: The Marketing team adamantly opposed Guest Checkout, arguing that losing first-purchase user data would cripple their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modeling and loyalty program segmentation.Security Team Conflict: The Security/Fraud team pushed back against frictionless features like quick-pay and auto-fill, citing increased risk of chargebacks and sophisticated bot fraud, requiring stricter verification protocols.The core challenge was to prioritize speed (low friction) without sacrificing data integrity or security compliance.2. Strategic Solution: Phased Implementation and Trade-OffsThe proposed solution was structured into two phases to manage budget, system limitations, and stakeholder compromises effectively.Phase 1: Quick Wins and Friction RemovalDuration: 3 MonthsPrimary Goal: Achieve a 10-percentage point reduction in abandonment (from 30% to 20%).Focus: Implementing changes with the highest immediate ROI and lowest technical debt. This phase focused on a mobile-first UI redesign and the deployment of the Guest Checkout feature.Phase 2: System Architecture and Revenue PotentialDuration: 6+ MonthsPrimary Goal: Address underlying legacy system limitations to enable future growth features.Focus: Developing the "To-Be" System Architecture Blueprint required for integrating a modern Customer Data Platform (CDP) and leveraging full quick-pay APIs (e.g., Apple Pay/Google Pay), which the existing legacy gateway could not support.3. Requirements Specification (Focus on Phase 1 Compromise)The requirements were explicitly defined to incorporate necessary friction points and stakeholder compromises:FR 1.1 (Guest Checkout with Compromise): The Guest Checkout flow must allow the transaction to complete without password creation, but it must also include a clear, pre-checked email opt-in box on the shipping address screen to mitigate the Marketing team's data loss concern.FR 1.2 (Mobile Optimization): For mobile users (responsible for 60% of current drop-offs), the system must detect device type and auto-select the correct keyboard (e.g., numeric for phone/card number).NFR 1.1 (Security Constraint): All guest transactions must pass a background fraud verification check on the final review page. Critically, this security check must not exceed 0.5 seconds of processing time to maintain the overall page load time of under 2.0 seconds.4. Financial Clarity and JustificationThe business case was built entirely on quantifiable revenue recovery and the introduction of a new success metric, providing clear ROI for the investment:Final Abandonment Rate: The current rate of 30% must be reduced to a Phase 1 Goal of 20%, representing a crucial 10-point reduction in user friction.Monthly Revenue Recovered: This 10-point improvement translates directly to recovering $166,667 per month in previously lost revenue, a strong, quantifiable ROI that justifies the development costs.Guest-to-Account Conversion (New KPI): To mitigate the risk raised by the Marketing team, a new success metric was established. The goal is to convert 15% of guest users to full accounts within 30 days post-purchase, ensuring that valuable CLV data is captured in a follow-up journey rather than being lost initially.The phased approach allowed the client to achieve significant, measurable financial recovery quickly while committing to the necessary long-term architectural upgrades needed for competitive, friction-free commerce.
