## 💰 Current State Financial Analysis

### Revenue Loss Calculation

**Current Cart Performance:**
- **Average Monthly Cart Initiations:** 16,667 carts
- **Current Completion Rate:** 35% (Desktop), 25% (Mobile avg)
- **Weighted Average Completion Rate:** 30%
- **Current Monthly Completed Orders:** 5,000 orders
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** $100.00

**Lost Revenue Analysis:**
```
Monthly Potential Revenue: 16,667 carts × $100 AOV = $1,666,700
Current Actual Revenue: 5,000 orders × $100 AOV = $500,000  
Monthly Lost Revenue: $1,666,700 - $500,000 = $1,166,700

Lost Revenue by Abandonment Stage:
├─ Account Creation Required: $500,000 (42.9% of losses)
├─ Shipping Information: $183,333 (15.7% of losses) 
├─ Payment Information: $233,333 (20.0% of losses)
└─ Final Processing: $250,000 (21.4% of losses)

Payment Stage Focus: $500,000 + $233,333 + $250,000 = $983,333
Target Recovery (50% improvement): $491,667 annually recoverable
Conservative Phase 1 Target: $166,667 monthly ($2M annually)

### 3-Year Financial Projection

| **Year** | **Revenue Recovery** | **Investment** | **Net Benefit** | **Cumulative ROI** |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Year 1** | $2,250,000 | $760,000 | $1,490,000 | 196% |

*Ongoing maintenance and optimization costs  
**Includes 10% year-over-year growth from continuous optimization

### Net Present Value (NPV) Analysis

**Assumptions:**
- **Discount Rate:** 8% (company's weighted average cost of capital)
- **Revenue Growth:** 10% annually after Year 1
- **Maintenance Costs:** 5% of initial investment annually

```
NPV Calculation (3 years):
Year 0: -$760,000 (initial investment)
Year 1: $1,490,000 / (1.08)¹ = $1,379,630
Year 2: $3,300,000 / (1.08)² = $2,829,218  
Year 3: $3,700,000 / (1.08)³ = $2,937,757

3-Year NPV = $1,379,630 + $2,829,218 + $2,937,757 - $760,000 = $6,386,605
